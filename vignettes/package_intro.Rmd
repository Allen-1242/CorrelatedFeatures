# Introduction

TangledFeatures automatically cleans column names in preparation for ingestion into a linear or logistic model. Categorical features that are unordered are automatically converted to dummy variables. You can turn this feature off in the hyper parameters, but it is not advisable to do this. 

Ordered features are not affected by this. Please specify in the input data frame if a categorical variable has an order, as TangledFeatures cannot do that automatically.
